# Instant-messenger---client
Client side messenger with GUI

This is the second part of my big project, part of my portfolio.

This program will run on a client. It will create a socket and establish a connection with the server.
Once the connection is established, the top bar for the text input will become active and will be possible to send messages to the server.
